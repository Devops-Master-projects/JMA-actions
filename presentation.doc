build first on ubuntu
the on 3 os [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macOS-latest]

syntax 
build on: ${{matrix.os}}

now push to private repo ecr or git hub
docker login
docker build 
docker tag and docker push or use and action since is a common step
serch googlr for  - docker build and push action

uses: mr-smithers-excellent/docker-build-push@v6
with:
  image: docker-hub-repo/image-name
  registry: docker.io
  username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }} -- github needs to authenticate with docker registry
  password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }} --  we gonna pass secrets as placeholders

  we no longer need all 3 os it was just for demo reasons ... we use ubuntu since it already has docker installed
